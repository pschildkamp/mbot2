== 5. The ultrasonic sensor module

With the ultrasonic sensor, the mBot can measure the distance to an object that is in front of it. The sensor emits sounds. These
reflect against the object and it takes a while for them to return: a very short echo, actually. The time that
takes indicates how far away the object is.

NOTE: Ultrasonic sound is sound with a very high pitch. So high that no human can hear it anymore. But some animals
can. A bat, for example. It does exactly what the mBot does: makes very high-pitched screams and listens to how long
it takes for the echo of its own scream to return.
Bats are so good at this that they can find and eat flies in the pitch dark! image:assignment5/bat-echo.png[]

.Step 1 - add the ultrasonic sensor
