== Facilitator instructions
Below you will find all assignment cards in order. During the workshop, hand out the assignment cards _per assignment_ to the groups. Take them back at the end of an assignment and then hand out the cards for the next assignment.

As an *introduction* you start with a short presentation in which you ask/explain what a robot actually is. (_A
computer-controlled machine with sensors._) You will also introduce the CyberPi, the mBot chassis (with only the
motors, wheels, line sensor and support studs for the mCore pre-assembled) and the mBlock programming environment. (_A
computer program for creating computer programs._)

For *chapter 1* the children only need the CyberPi module.

In *chapter 2* the children first mount the CyberPi on the mBot. They then create a program to manually steer the mBot over the
circuit with the Joystick.

In *chapter 3* they learn how the code is sent to the MBot.

In *chapter 4* they will automate the steering by using the line-following sensor. At the beginning of the assignment,
you have to explain the difference between the interactive mode of the CyberPi with the
image:block/starting.png[Starting, 100] block and the USB cable.

In *chapter 5*, the children first assemble the ultrasonic distance sensor. You can provide some explanation for this
by making a comparison with bats. They then expand the program from the previous assignment with code
to respond to an obstacle that may be on the course. A cow crossing the road?

In *chapter 6*, they learn how to combine the internet with AI with the CyberPi and MBot
